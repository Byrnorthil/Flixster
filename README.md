### Notes
Again, I have a slow computer, so I spent a lot of time waiting. A big problem was that the walkthrough told me to contact the Configurations API on MovieDatabase's site to get picture widths, but did not explain how. I spent several hours trying different ways of doing so, and after fitting in all my logic could not figure out how to parse the JSON I stored in my file, using the libraries provided.
